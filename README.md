- Hold left click to drag certain objects, release to let object go.
- Hold control to crouch.

To run the game, just double click on the .exe file if you were to download the build.
If you instead downloaded the entire Unity Project itself, go ahead and just put it into
Unity Editor after downloading and thus from there you can play and run as you please.

Limitations - Bugs
No real obvious bugs in the game, only a small physics based issue
where if the player hops on grabbable objects, they can possibly
pull themselves upwards but it requires good timing to perfectly
pull off this bug.

Stuck? Here is some help,
- Overall the game should be pretty straightfoward, look out for signs that explain what you need
to do to get over certain obstacles. I recommend if you can't reach up high in certain places just
find boxes all over the map and stack them up high to reach these areas.
